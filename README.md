# SkidMenu

A BepInEx IL2CPP mod menu for Among Us. SkidMenu combines a large number of public features from various Among Us cheat menus (such as MalumMenu, Hydra, ElysiumModMenu, Hyper Menu), though not everything here is skidded. Some features are original and just got added because they seemed like a fun idea, like the notification system, kill aura, votekick, lag compensation, instant vote, load/save info, spoof level/platform/name, full randomizer, chat sender and many other stuff.

**Current build:** `1.1.0` (Stable)

> This build is labeled Stable. That tho doesnt mean that nothing will break. It just means that no errors occured while playing for long time. Some functions may break mid-game, cause disconnects, or behave like shit. This is normal given how many features are packed in.

## Use this responsibly

SkidMenu is meant for private lobbies with friends who know you're using it and are fine with it. It is not meant to be used in public lobbies against strangers who never agreed to play against someone with a cheat menu. Using it that way ruins the game for people who just wanted a normal match.

SkidMenu is not affiliated with, endorsed by, or sponsored by Innersloth in any way. Whatever you choose to do with this menu, including any bans, account issues, or other consequences, is entirely your own responsibility, not the menu's.

## Why Closed Source

Honestly, there's no big reason behind it. Part of it is that I'm using this project to learn a bit of reverse engineering, and keeping it closed source is just part of that. I'll make it open source sooner or later . Spoiler: it's obfuscated with ConfuserEx.

## Compatible Among Us versions

| Supported | `2026.3.31`, `2026.6.5` |
| Tolerated (some features may not work) | `2026.2.24`, `2026.3.17` |

Running a different version than the ones above isn't recommended, you'll get a warning popup in the main menu.
